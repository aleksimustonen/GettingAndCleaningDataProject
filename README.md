# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project

### Overview

This repo contains 
- script to clean up a dirty data set
- the cleaned data set
- a codebook that describes the data set

Dirty dataset is available at
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### How the script works

run run_analysis.R
It
- installs required data.table library
- downloads dirty data ZIP and uncompresses it
- reads in the relevant parts of the dirty dataset
- relabels the data based on features.txt and activity_labels.txt in the dirty dataset
- strips the data, leaving only those parts that contain std deviations or means
- merges test data and training data together
- calculates the average of each variable of each activity per each subject
- saves the result to a file ./tidy/tidyData.txt

### Tidy data

Tidy data is available in this repository, generated by the script. Find it at
